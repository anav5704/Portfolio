![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/Portfolio/blob/main/docs/portfolio.png)

This is a simple portfolio website I made in the first few months of me getting into web development. It turned out quite nice as it has some nice animations here and there. It is hosted on Netlify and houses my other projects from the vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS days.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the ```live server``` extension installed in VS Code. Then fork and clone the repo. Once cloned, just fire up the live server and enjoy.
